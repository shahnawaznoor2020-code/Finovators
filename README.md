# GigBit - Gig Worker Payment & Benefits Platform

GigBit is a full-stack fintech platform for gig workers that unifies payouts, protection, and approvals across mobile and web.

**Journey:** Earn -> Sync -> Withdraw -> Claim -> Manage

## Current Hackathon Status

- Project is implemented end-to-end
- Team size: 5
- Contributors split:
  - 3 members on App
  - 2 members on Web
- Working model: branch-based development with periodic PR updates for inspection

## Problem

Gig workers and operations teams often rely on disconnected tools for core finance workflows:

- Earnings reconciliation across multiple platforms
- Delayed withdrawals and poor withdrawable balance visibility
- Separate loan and insurance request channels
- Weak approval/status visibility for workers
- Manual operational overhead for admins

## Solution

GigBit provides one connected financial operations system:

- Worker Mobile App (Flutter): withdrawals, loans, insurance, notifications
- Web Portals: product landing + admin operations
- Shared Backend (Node.js + TypeScript): consistent business logic
- Reliable Data Layer: PostgreSQL + Redis
